# Quill Clean-Architecture-Backend

**Quill** is a robust and scalable backend API for a modern blogging platform, designed and built with a focus on clean code, performance, and professional software engineering principles. This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of building production-ready applications using ASP.NET Core, Clean Architecture, and a range of industry-standard technologies.

### Core Concept

The core idea behind Quill is to provide the complete server-side functionality for an interactive blogging application. It empowers users to create and publish content, follow other authors to build a personalized feed, and manage their profiles and interactions. This project is developed as a **backend-only** solution, providing a powerful API for any potential frontend client (web, mobile, etc.) to consume.

### Architectural Highlights

The foundation of Quill is built upon the **Clean Architecture** philosophy, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, testability, and long-term maintainability.

*   **Hybrid Data Access Model:** To achieve maximum performance, Quill utilizes a hybrid data access strategy. **Dapper** is employed for high-performance read operations with raw SQL queries, while **Entity Framework Core**'s powerful Change Tracker and transaction management capabilities are leveraged for all write operations (Create, Update, Delete).
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles:** The core business logic and entities reside in the `Domain` and `Application` layers, completely independent of technical implementation details like databases or frameworks.
*   **Repository & Unit of Work Patterns:** Data access is cleanly abstracted, and database transactions are managed centrally, ensuring data integrity.
*   **RESTful API Design:** The API is designed following REST principles, with resource-oriented URLs, correct HTTP verb usage, and standardized error responses.

### Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** ASP.NET Core 9.0
*   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Data Access:** Hybrid - Entity Framework Core (for writes) & Dapper (for reads)
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Validation:** FluentValidation
*   **Mapping:** AutoMapper
*   **Logging:** Serilog
*   **API Documentation:** Swashbuckle (Swagger)
*   **Testing:** xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions
*   **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

### Project Status & Roadmap

This project is under active development, evolving from a solid architectural foundation to a feature-rich, production-grade application. The current implementation includes core functionalities like user authentication, post and tag management, and a subscription system.

Future development will focus on advanced features such as:
*   API Versioning & Rate Limiting
*   Pagination for list-based endpoints
*   File Uploads for profile pictures
*   Integration Testing & CI/CD Pipelines
*   Caching with Redis for performance enhancement
*   Advanced security features like token revocation (logout)

This repository stands as a testament to modern backend development practices in the .NET ecosystem.
